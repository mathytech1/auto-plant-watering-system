# Auto Plant Watering with Arduino and MATLAB

## Introduction
The "Auto Plant Watering with Arduino and MATLAB" project aims to automate the process of watering a plant based on its soil moisture levels, without the need for human intervention. This system uses a combination of hardware components and MATLAB software to monitor soil moisture and activate a watering system when necessary.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this project was to design a system that automatically waters a plant based on the moisture content in the soil. The system ensures that the plant receives water when needed, promoting better growth and reducing the need for human involvement in routine watering.
